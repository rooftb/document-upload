# Document-Upload Assessment

This is the repo for my submission for the Document-Upload assessment. I have to say, this project was a lot of fun. I used React + Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for all of it. There are some sprinklings of [Flowbite](https://www.flowbite-react.com/) and [Material-Tailwind](https://www.material-tailwind.com/) premade components here and there. They made it possible to get this completed on time.

You may notice some random `span` tags interjected throughout components where they shouldn't be. That's because the fonts used in some places are from Trial versions, so they put a large "DEMO" character in place of non-alphabetical characters. I got around this by essentially escaping those characters and using another similar font.

There's a lot more I would like to do with this if I'm honest. It could be organized a bit tidier and I would like to eventually add the drag-and-drop functionality that displays the file's name. Regardless, I'm proud of my submission here at the eleventh hour.

Thank you for your consideration.
